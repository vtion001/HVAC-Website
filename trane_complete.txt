Smart Home Comfort Systems: Energy Efficient, Convenient, & Customizable Imagine a home where your energy bills are lower, you have full control over the climate, and every room feels just right. Today's home comfort goes beyond just temperature--it's about having control, breathing cleaner air, and enjoying true peace of mind. A smart HVAC system from Trane offers custom comfort, enhanced efficiency, seamless connections with other smart home devices, and reliability. The result? A healthier, more efficient home environment. Start with an energy-saving smart thermostat paired with the Trane Home App A smart thermostat turns your heating and cooling system into a smart HVAC system. A Trane smart thermostat paired with the Trane Home App is your key to custom control of your HVAC system and energy savings. You can also seamlessly integrate other smart home devices and manage them all from the palm of your hand or by telling your voice assistant what you want to happen. Check out Trane’s Best Smart Thermostats for an idea of the possibilities. Enjoy uninterrupted comfort and peace of mind with Trane Diagnostics When you have a Trane smart thermostat and you opt into Trane Diagnostics through the Home App, you allow your Trane dealer to monitor your HVAC system remotely. Remote monitoring of your HVAC system’s health allows your dealer to help ensure your uninterrupted comfort. If they see an issue with system performance, they’ll troubleshoot remotely (with your permission) and fix the problem remotely if they can. Otherwise, they’ll schedule an on-site visit, and the technician will arrive with the knowledge and parts to fix the problem. Customize your home comfort further with a zoned HVAC system In Trane Link™ zoning , a variable-speed system, combined with HVAC zone dampers, an HVAC zone control hub, HVAC sensors, and a smart thermostat (UX360), provides precise temperature and humidity control throughout every corner of your home. Take control of your comfort and customize the temperature room by room, zone by zone. Components work together to optimize your comfort and energy use. Improve indoor air quality for enhanced comfort and health According to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Americans spend 90% of our time indoors. The EPA also says that indoor air pollution levels can be as high, and even exceed, outdoor pollution levels. That’s why it’s so important to be aware of your indoor air quality (IAQ) . Your Trane dealer can perform indoor air quality testing and equip you with an indoor air quality monitor that connects seamlessly with your HVAC system to help monitor humidity levels and possible pollutants. They can also make recommendations for whole-house solutions to improve indoor air quality, based on the issues affecting your home. Understand ing home comfort technology When you’re planning to install a new HVAC system, it’s important to know these terms. Smart

Protect your system with one of our top-of-the-line warranties. Base Limited Warranty Base Limited Warranty goes into effect for units that aren’t registered or were registered more than 60 days after installation. It covers parts that might fail due to manufacturer defect, but not the labor to repair them. In most cases, this warranty lasts five years, but length of coverage may change depending on the product. * See Limited Warranty Details Outdoor Units Warranty (ACs & Heat Pumps) English | French Furnaces Warranty English | French Ductless Systems Warranty English | French Air Handlers Warranty English | French Packaged Units Warranty English | French Coils Warranty English | French Registered Limited Warranty Registered Limited Warranty lengthens the term of your warranty if your product is registered within 60 days of installation.

Contact your local dealer to learn about your available options. Contact your local dealer Is your warranty eligible for transfer? * If you’re preparing to sell your home, you may be able to transfer your Registered Limited Warranty to a new homeowner, which could make your home a lot more attractive to potential buyers. To make a successful transfer, you’ll have to complete the transfer within 90 days of home sale/purchase, and pay a one-time transfer fee of $99 with a credit card. But keep in mind, whether a transfer is possible depends on when you registered your unit: Registered before Aug. 1, 2011 Not Transferable: Warranty transfers became available to Trane customers on Aug. 1, 2011, therefore any product registered before that date IS NOT eligible for transfer.

Find a Local Pro Ductless Mini-Splits: A Complete Guide Ductless mini-split air conditioners and mini-split heating and cooling systems are gaining in popularity in the United States as more and more homeowners discover the benefits. Similar to a traditional ducted split system, a ductless mini-split system can heat and cool your home, only it does it without the use of ductwork. Trane dealers install, maintain, and repair Mitsubishi mini-split systems . Read on to learn everything you need to know about these ductless mini-split systems. What is a mini-split heat pump? A mini-split heat pump, or ductless heat pump , is the outdoor heat pump that is central to heating and cooling (or just cooling) your home. It operates the same way that a traditional split-system heat pump does. It uses the refrigeration cycle to maintain comfort year-round. When it’s cold out, the heat pump extracts heat from the air outside and transfers it into your home. When it’s warm out, a heat pump reverses operation. A reversing valve redirects the flow of refrigerant. Then, the heat pump pivots to a cooling function and removes heat from the home and sends it outside. What is a mini-split AC/mini-split air conditioner? A mini-split AC unit, or mini-split air conditioner, is a ductless air conditioning system . Instead of both heating and cooling your home, these indoor units are designed specifically for cooling. They’re quieter and more efficient than a window AC unit or a through-the-wall air conditioner. What are the best mini-split air conditioner options? We believe Mitsubishi Electric offers the best mini-split AC units for home use. They are pioneers in ductless systems, and we recommend them to homeowners looking for a ductless cooling solution. What are the benefits of a mini-split system? The biggest benefit of a mini-split system is that it gives you the ability to heat and cool a space (or your whole house) without installing ductwork. In an existing home, that’s a big deal. Beyond that obvious benefit, here are some others of a mini-split AC and heat system or a mini-split AC. Highly energy-efficient Variable-speed for better humidity control Personalized comfort in each zone (for multi-zone mini-split systems) Control via a wall unit, remote control, smartphone app, or voice assistant Whisper-quiet indoor units, quiet outdoor heat pumps All-electric heating and cooling can reduce carbon emissions What are the downsides of a mini-split system? The initial cost could be a potential downside. Look for available rebates and other financial incentives. HVAC financing can also help you afford the system. Some people don’t like the aesthetics of the indoor units. But you’d be surprised at how many discreet indoor options are available. Most units are super-quiet. Where does a mini-split system make sense? A mini-split air conditioner or mini-split AC and heat system makes sense in any

Common Issues Explore the issue that best describes your system’s problem for an expert recommendation on what you can do. My system isn’t cooling Possible cause: Your circuit breaker tripped Solution: Turn off your HVAC system, find the circuit breaker, and reset the system by flipping the switch off and back on. Possible cause: Your thermostat is set incorrectly. Solution: Lower the temperature on your thermostat, then wait to see if you feel a change. Or, try turning the thermostat off and back on, then resetting the temperature. Possible cause: Your system is blocked by debris or contaminants. Solution: Clear any excess debris you can safely remove from the outside area surrounding your system. Do not attempt to clear any debris inside the system. My utility bill is higher than expected Possible cause: Your HVAC system is the wrong size for your home. Solution: Contact an HVAC professional to accurately assess the temperature needs for your home, and discuss investing in a properly sized system if needed. Possible cause: Your HVAC system is switching between heating and cooling too frequently Solution: Consider investing in a smart thermostat that allows you to schedule your heating and cooling based on your changing needs. Or, create zones in your home for temperature control. Possible cause: Your thermostat is working overtime to maintain the temperature you set. Solution: Try to set your thermostat to a temperature similar to the one outside. If the temperature inside is drastically different than outside, your thermostat has to work harder to maintain it. My system won’t turn off Possible cause: Your HVAC system is the wrong size for your home. Solution: Contact an HVAC professional to accurately assess the temperature needs for your home, and discuss investing in a properly sized system if needed. Possible cause: Your thermostat is set incorrectly. Solution: If you set your thermostat too low in the summer, or too high in the winter, your system will have to continously run to reach and maintain your settings. Try setting a moderate temperature instead. Possible cause: A part of your system is malfunctioning. Solution: Faulty coils, fans, switches and more could result in your HVAC system not receiving the message to stop heating or cooling. Contact an HVAC professional to troubleshoot further. My system isn’t heating Possible cause: The fuel source is shut off. Solution: Check your system’s shut-off valve to make sure it wasn’t accidentally switched. If the shut-off valve is on, turn it off. Possible cause: Your circuit breaker tripped. Solution: Turn off your HVAC system, find the circuit breaker, and r

Find a Local Pro Keep your system working at its best Choose your unit, system, or component for details on what’s causing your issues and how you can resolve them. When you should schedule preventive maintenance Adopting a seasonal maintenance routine for your system can help you stay comfortable during the coldest and hottest times of the year. Cooling 1x a year Cooling season: Time of year when temperatures are at their warmest, so you may run your air conditioning more regularly. Peak season is usually May to August, but can vary by region. Perform service on your air conditioner in late winter or early spring, before the cooling season begins. Heating 1x a year Heating season: Time of year when temperatures are at their coldest, so you may run your heat more frequently. Peak season is usually November to February, but can vary by region. Ask a technician to inspect your furnace in late summer or early fall, before the heating season takes off. What you can do yourself Before you call a technician to service your system, cross these tasks off your maintenance to-do list. Clean what you can Clean or replace any filters inside your system’s indoor unit. Also, clear away any dirt, leaves, and debris from your system’s outdoor unit. Pro tip: Keep plants, weeds, shrubs, and other vegetation at least 18 inches away from your outdoor unit to avoid debris buildup. Watch out for leaks Check for leaks or holes in your system’s ductwork, evaporator coil, or cabinet (the outside “shell” of your unit that holds all the parts inside together). Keep your ears open Listen closely for any strange noises when your system starts. If you hear any, call a technician to inspect the problem more closely. Perform a smell test Take note of any suspicious or unusual odors when your system starts. If you smell anything strange, call a technician to identify the issue. Keep your vents clear Make sure you move any furniture, drapes, rugs, etc. that could be blocking your supply and return vents. When to call a technician There are some situations only a professional should handle. Here’s when you need to call in an expert. Your energy bills keep rising If your utility bills increase but your overall usage remains the same, one or more components of your system may not be working as they should. Your comfort isn’t consistent If your air conditioner, furnace or other HVAC system can’t maintain consistent temperatures, a technician is the best person to investigate the issue. Your unit’s fins are damaged Bent or damaged fins on your air conditioner or heat pump’s outdoor unit can trap heat inside your unit, causing performance and temperature issues. Your unit takes on a lot of water Excessive water, such as from a flood, can seriously damage your unit’s electrical systems. If you suspect that your unit’s mechanical equipment might have water damage, do not attempt to resolve the issue yourself. Call a technician. Electrical problem

Over the years, we’ve developed a reputation for innovative technology that results in highly energy-efficient HVAC equipment, including forced air gas furnaces. Wide selection of gas furnaces We have a wide variety of natural gas furnaces to fit your needs and budget. If you don’t have natural gas available in your neighborhood, certain furnaces can use propane if your dealer installs a conversion kit. Two-stage furnaces and single-stage furnaces can both keep your home comfortable in the wintertime. Your Trane dealer can answer specific questions you may have about which furnace is right for your home and climate. High-efficiency furnaces High-efficiency furnaces are condensing furnaces, with two heat exchangers to help ensure fuel efficiency. A furnace with an Annual Fuel Utilization Efficiency (AFUE) of 90 or higher qualifies as high efficiency. Our 96 Modulating Variable Speed Gas Furnace with an AFUE of up to 97.3% is our most efficient furnace. “A high-efficiency furnace makes sense in regions with colder climates and higher utility costs.  These furnaces use less gas to produce the same amount of heat, which translates to lower energy bills for homeowners.” -Amy Gulas, Furnace Product Manager Compatible with a dual-fuel heat pump system In addition to the traditional furnace and air conditioner combination, Trane furnaces are suita

More complex projects may require additional labor and costs to install correctly. Keep a lookout for key factors that affect HVAC prices. Find a Local Pro Four Top Factors to Consider Climate & Region Different climates require different heating or cooling solutions. Where you live affects which HVAC products you need as well as their efficiency. A cold, northern climate may require more heating, while a warm, southern climate may require more cooling. The wrong system can fail to keep your home comfortable and can cost you more each month on your utility bills. Your Home Your home's size and insulation can affect your system sizing and setup. Customization and layout may increase the complexity of your HVAC installation project and result in additional labor and product costs. Larger homes may need larger units or multiple systems, or your home may have hard-to-access spots. A historic home may need retrofitting. Improving insulation can help your home better retain heated or cooled air. This can help your HVAC system use less energy to maintain the same level of comfort. Existing Ductwork Good ductwork installation is essential for the efficient distribution of heated/cooled air. You get a higher level of comfort and spend less on monthly heating and cooling costs when your ductwork system is properly designed and installed. New ductwork can cost $3,000-$10,000 depending on system size, complexity, labor, and materials. Product Features You may choose special systems or add features to optimize your home comfort. These can include climate zones with a ComfortLink™ II Zoning System, a Trane CleanEffects™ Air Cleaner, an energy-efficient system that saves on monthly bills, or other options. Review product features and pricing Discover product features within a line of products and why you may be paying more for some units over others. Prices are not final!

Is a Zoned HVAC System Right for My Home? HVAC Maintenance Tips HVAC Troubleshooting Tips HVAC Zoning FAQs What is an HVAC zoning system? An HVAC zoning system splits your home into various zones that can be heated or cooled separately. Motorized modulating HVAC zone dampers are installed in your ductwork. The dampers control the airflow of cool or warm air to rooms where it is needed. The primary goal of zoning is to maintain a consistent temperature throughout the house. Each zone has zone sensors that communicate temperature and humidity data to a system controller. The controller opens or closes the dampers partway or completely to provide precise HVAC zone control. The result? Precise comfort control. You can access the system through a smart thermostat or via the Trane Home App . Is zoned HVAC right for my home? HVAC zoning can be especially beneficial for multi-level or spacious homes with heating and cooling issues. Zoning can improve the efficiency of your systems and even out the temperatures in your home overall. For example, a dual-zone HVAC system can solve the problem of a house that’s hot upstairs and cold downstairs . How many zones can I have? With Trane Link Zoning, you can have up to 6 zones. Be sure to talk with your local Trane dealer about the optimal zoning system for your ho

Why choose a hybrid system A hybrid system includes both a heat pump and a gas furnace and will operate the heat pump during milder temperatures when it’s more efficient. As the outdoor temperature gets colder, the system will automatically switch over to the gas furnace. Not only does this switch allow for maximum comfort but also maximum efficiency, which could save you money in the process. ADD TO YOUR HOME COMFORT SYSTEM Adding an air cleaner can also help reduce pollen, pet dander, dust, and smoke in your home An air cleaner is integral part of a home comfort system. An air cleaner can filter dust and pollutants out of the air you breathe, and keeps your rugs and home furnishings cleaner as well. Reduced pollen, dust, pet dander, smoke, etc., could help reduce allergy and asthma discomfort. A Trane CleanEffects® Whole Home Air Cleaner air filtration system can remove up to 99.98%* of airborne particles that pass through the reusable filter. *Based on third party testing of particle removal efficiency down to 0.3 microns (2005).

Learn How HVAC Can Help Where Is the Air Filter in My HVAC System? HVAC Air Filter Cleaning and Maintenance Guide FAQs What is an HVAC air filter? An HVAC air filter goes inside the HVAC system or ductwork to help catch small particles from the air such as dust, pollen, and pet dander. By acting like a net, it traps them, protecting the HVAC equipment from debris while also removing these unwanted particles from the air we breathe. These filters are held in place with a plastic or metal frame but the filter is easily removable and usually looks like folded or pleated paper. Why do I need an air filter? An air filter is important because it removes tiny, harmful particles from the air that can’t be seen. When pollen, dust, or pet dander are in the air, it can make breathing harder, especially for people with allergies or asthma. Air filters also keep dirt and debris out of the HVAC system to ensure proper functionality. What are air filters made of? The most common materials air filters are made of include fiberglass, pleated cotton, cloth, or carbon. The case that holds the air filter in place within the HVAC system is typically made of metal or plastic. Consult your local Trane dealer for guidance on which type of filter is best for your system. What is a MERV rating? MERV stands for Minimum Efficiency Reporting Values and this value indicates how effective the filter is at trapping allergens and

Contact customer service Ask about Trane products, warranty, and dealers. Our customer service agents can answer your general HVAC questions. Contact a dealer A dealer can help with your specific questions about buying, replacing, operating, or maintaining your HVAC system. You can also schedule a visit to get a quote. FAQs Where can I find my owner’s manual? Owner’s manuals can be found on our Owner’s Manuals page or through your local dealer. How do I register my product? Register your product on our Warranty & Registration page. You will need your unit’s serial number, model number, and installation date. Locate your product’s serial number on the nameplate, metal tag, or sticker that should be on your unit. If you don’t have this information or your sales invoice on hand, your local dealer can provide it to you. Not sure if your product is already registered? Verify your registration or look up an existing warranty . For more assistance, call 855-260-2975 . Is annual maintenance a requirement for my warranty? Yes. System maintenance is a requirement for the Base Limited and Registered Limited Warranties. We recommend maintenance twice a year with a local dealer. Locate a dealer to schedule your annual maintenance. Can I transfer my warranty? Base Limited and Registered Limited Warranties are attached to a specific serial number and do not “travel” with the homeowner. If you sell your home, you cannot transfer your warranty to your new residence. Transferring your Registered Limited Warranty to the new homeowner maintains the original Registered Limited Warranty period. This means the new homeowner gets the benefit of the remaining term of the unit’s original limited warranty. Transferring your limited warranty must happen within 90 days of the new homeowner’s purchase. Transferring a Registered Limited Warranty costs a one-time fee of $99. You can only pay the fee by credit card. Base Limited Warranties stay with the product, so they don’t need to be transferred between homeowners and a fee is not required. Optional Extended Warranties are transferred via outside parties and are not subject to the transfer fee. Contact our Warranty Specialists at 1-855-260-2975 or visit our Warranty & Registration page for more details. How do I get support for my Trane Smart Thermostat or Trane Home Account? Resources and support material can be found on the Trane Home Support Center . How do I know my Trane products are reliable? Each Trane product is put through 16 weeks of extreme testing in all elements. If a product doesn’t pass our tests, it doesn’t go into to production. Trane was also announced as a 5-star Smart Thermostat Brand in the 2021 America’s Most Trusted Study .* In addition, Trane CleanEffects® was determined to be the most effective whole-house air filtration system by a Harvard-led independent research project on the air cleaning performance of multiple in-duct and portable devices.

Find a dealer Further repair or replace guidance Read through the Repair list and the Replace list. Make note of which statements apply to your HVAC system or unit (air conditioner, heat pump, furnace, or air handler.) If more statements in the Repair column apply to you, HVAC repairs make sense. If more statements in the Replace column apply, then you should start planning for HVAC replacement. Repair if... Your warranty is active. Your repairs may be covered. Your product's age is less than its life expectancy. A/C: 12-15 years Furnace: 15-20 years Heat Pump: 15-20 years Your product had 0-2 repairs in the last 3 years. If this is your 1st or 2nd repair, your system may still have a lot of value left. HVAC repairs may be your best option. Your product’s performance - the unit generally functions as well as before. Consider long-term value. The less time you plan to stay, you will get less value from a new system compared to its cost. Quick AC repairs may be all you need. You plan to live in your home less than 7 years. Maintain the system and make needed repairs. Minor repairs are a more cost-effective solution than a new HVAC system. If you list your home for sale, a potential buyer may ask for a reduction in price if the HVAC system is in poor shape. Your product is less than 10 years old. Newer models run more efficiently and keep monthly costs down. Newer units have higher efficiency with a higher SEER2 rating (13-22). According to the Department of Energy (DOE) , The standard model can save 20-40% in monthly costs when compared to an older unit. T

Find a Local Pro Meet The Next Generation of HVAC Systems Learn more about changing refrigerant regulations and how Trane’s commitment to innovation and sustainability is driving us to create products that offer superior performance and energy-savings potential. Superior Performance Meets Future-Proof Sustainability What’s Driving the Refrigerant Change? New industry regulations require HVAC systems manufactured after January 1, 2025 to use refrigerants with low global warming potential. What Does This Mean for Homeowners? Trane’s new line of residential HVAC equipment won’t just use refrigerant that lowers your carbon footprint — new design features on many models help systems operate more efficiently, qualifying them for rebates and helping you save money on energy bills. What’s Next for Residential HVAC Systems? Trane will continue to supply refrigerant for your existing HVAC equipment, but when your HVAC system requires service, you may need to decide whether to repair your current system, or replace it with a new one that uses more eco-friendly refrigerant. Our HVAC pros can help you decide what’s best for you and your home. Making Comfort More Sustainable For years, air conditioners, heat pumps, and other HVAC equipment used refrigerant called R-410A. Now, HVAC systems manufactured after January 1, 2025 are required to use refrigerants with low global warming potential. New Trane HVAC systems will use R-454B refrigerant. R-454B helps our systems achieve zero ozone depletion potential and a 78% reduction in global warming potential compared to traditional refrigerants. Behind the scenes, we’ve been testing R-454B in our products for years to ensure they deliver superior performance while withstanding the elements. R-454B is designed to meet current and future refrigerant regulations, so you can be comfortable for years to come. Learn more about why we’re making the switch. Cutting-Edge Safety Features Every product that leaves our factory floors has to meet our high standards of sustainability, efficiency, and safety. Learn more about our new Refrigerant Detection System, designed to help ensure safe performance without sacrificing whole-home comfort. To Replace, Or Not to Replace? Learn how Trane and its network of dealers will continue to service older HVAC equipment, and whether it’s best to repair your existing system or replace it with a more efficient one.

Find a Local Pro Electrification: Heat Pumps to Heat and Cool Your Home You have the power to create a sustainable and more affordable future. It can start with how you heat and cool your home. Switching from a gas furnace and air conditioner system to an electric heat pump system is what electrification is all about. How does a heat pump work to heat AND cool your home? A heat pump uses the refrigeration cycle to exchange heat, moving warm air into your home during heat mode and moving warm air out of your home during cooling mode. Heat pump technology is not new. Heat pumps have been around since the 1950s and 1960s. Trane has 60 years of engineering experience in making heat pumps a reliable heating and cooling solution. Do heat pumps work in cold weather? Yes. Performance is based on the system matchup, but in general, our current variable-speed heat pumps are more efficient at heating in cold temperatures, delivering 100% heating capacity down to around 27° F and 70% down to about 5° F. We have a true cold climate heat pump coming soon that will be able to deliver 100% heating capacity at much lower temperatures. How long do heat pumps last? In general, heat pumps will last about 15 years, the same as air conditioners. By changing the filter regularly and scheduling professional HVAC maintenance, you may be able to prolong the life of your heat pump system. Conversely, by ignoring maintenance needs, you can shorten the lifespan. How much energy can I save with a heat pump system? Energy-efficient heat pumps can save you up to 50% on your heating and cooling bills when you replace an older AC and furnace. In addition, Residential heat pumps can reduce your carbon footprint by 38-53%* when switching from a natural gas furnace. *According to a U.C. Davis study published in Energy Policy How much does a heat pump cost? Your heat pump installation cost will vary based on several factors, including: The size of the unit in tons The efficiency ratings Compressor speeds ( single-stage, two-stage, multi-speed, variable speed ) Size and condition of the existing ductwork The complexity of the installation A ballpark estimate for a split system heat pump would be between $8,600 on the low end for a single-stage system and $25,000 for a premium variable speed system. Keep in mind that qualifying heat pumps are eligible for heat pump rebates of up to $8,000, depending on where you live and your income. Whichever system you choose, you’ll want to explore HVAC financing . Explore savings Understand ing heat pump terminology When you’re planning to install a new heat pump system, it’s important to know these terms. Electrification Electrification in HVAC refers to the transition to all-electric heating and cooling and the move away from burning fossil fuels to heat your home. Trane heat pumps provide a way to do that, offering comfort you can count on. Read more about electrification Air Source Heat Pump An air source heat

Why choose a Trane traditional thermostat Our traditional thermostats include basic programmable thermostats and entry-level non-programmable thermostats. Like every Trane product, reliability is built in. You might choose one of these thermostats if you feel like you don’t want or need all of the extra options that come with smart thermostats . Ease of use Traditional thermostats are easy to use. Non-programmable thermostats are the simplest. You set the indoor temperature you want, and it stays there until you change it. Programmable thermostats have an intuitive interface that allows you to set a schedule for different times of day and days of the week. Setting a lower or higher temperature (depending on the season) for while you’re away can help you save money on your energy bills. Digital thermostats improve visibility of important data If you grew up with (or still have!) the old circular dial thermostat with tiny numbers or a toggle switch thermostat with equally tiny numbers, you’ll appreciate the digital display of our newer traditional thermostats. The inside temperature is displayed large enough to be seen easily. Depending on the unit, you may have a touchscreen or buttons to push to raise or lower the temperature. Most units also display the time, and some can display the outdoor temperature or indoor humidity level. Compatibility with single-stage and two-stage systems If you have a single-stage or two-stage HVAC system, our traditional thermostats are compatible.

Top 5 Causes of Frozen Evaporator Coils and How to Fix Them Coils Maintenance Tips Coil Troubleshooting Tips Coils FAQs What is an evaporator coil? The evaporator coil plays a crucial part in your cooling system - whether you have a central air conditioner or heat pump. Your system’s evaporator coil absorbs the heat and moisture from the air inside your home. It’s located inside your home inside the air handler or attached to the furnace, depending on your heating and cooling system. It works with the condenser coil and other system components to complete the refrigeration cycle that cools your home. What happens if I have dirty coils? Your evaporator coil can collect dust if the >air filter becomes clogged. A dirty evaporator coil can lead to less efficient cooling. The dust acts as an insulator, causing your cooling system to run longer to achieve the desired temperature. Dirty coils mean decreased efficiency and increased costs. Can I clean the evaporator coil myself? No. For your safety, leave this task to an HVAC professional. The evaporator coil is filled with refrigerant in a gaseous form and damaging the coils could cause a refrigerant leak. HVAC maintenance, except changing your air filters , is best left to trained HVAC technicians. If you damage your system going the DIY route, you could void your warranty. How long do evaporator coils last? With

What Is a Smart Thermostat? What exactly does a smart thermostat do? By Anne Fonda A smart thermostat, or Wi-Fi thermostat, is a thermostat that can be controlled by a phone, tablet, smart speaker, or another internet-connected device. Generally, they will also allow you to incorporate them into home automation systems. Smart thermostats also allow you to schedule your desired temperature so that you can find your perfect balance between comfort and energy efficiency. Some smart thermostats can even learn your temperature preferences and automatically set a schedule.  In addition, some smart thermostats have geofencing, which uses GPS or RFID to trigger the thermostat to start heating or cooling to your preferred temperature when you’re close to home. Benefits of Smart Thermostats Smart thermostats are a serious upgrade from both standard thermostats and programmable thermostats. You get: Improved comfort and convenience Enhanced energy management Potentially lower energy costs based on your usage habits Can you just replace a thermostat with a smart thermostat? In most cases, yes. You need a central HVAC system, strong WiFi, and a smartphone. Do your research to find the best option for your home because not all smart thermostats are alike. For a Trane thermostat, your local dealer should install it to ensure the best results. Schedule now Why Choose a Trane Smart Thermostat? Trane smart thermostats are several steps above the products you’ll find online. It’s one of the reasons Trane achieved a 5-star Smart Thermostat ranking in the 2022 America’s Most Trusted® study. In addition, Trane earned the 2025 America’s Most Trusted® HVAC Brand for overall quality and performance. This is the 11th year in a row that Trane has earned the title.

                  2024 By Anne Fonda You’re familiar with telehealth - where you meet with a healthcare provider virtually. They ask you some questions, diagnose your issue, maybe write a prescription, and you’re on the road to recovery. Trane Diagnostics is like that, only for your HVAC system. What is Trane Remote Diagnostics? Trane Diagnostics is an added feature you can opt into through the Trane Home App . It allows your preferred Trane dealer to monitor your HVAC system remotely. Your remote diagnostics-enabled Trane smart thermostat sends the data in real time via the mobile app. It’s important to note that the WiFi thermostat must be a Trane product. We offer Trane's WiFi Thermostas which are compatible with Trane Choice Equipment as well as Trane's premier equipment. Trane Diagnostics is not compatible with other smart thermostat brands. Good news for those new to Trane - your HVAC system doesn’t have to be a Trane system to benefit from Trane Diagnostics. As long as you have a Trane smart thermostat and have the Trane Home App, you can opt into remote diagnostics. For instance, the XL824 smart thermostat is compatible with virtually all conventional HVAC systems and is Trane Home-enabled. Visit Trane Home Support to find step-by-step directions to Opt In or Opt Out of Trane Diagnostics via the Trane Home App. How Trane Diagnostics works You opt in once and then the HVAC remote monitoring starts. Your thermostat sends all kinds of real-time data to your dealer via the app. They monitor this data remotely, essentially giving your Trane technician support every day of the year - even when you’re on vacation. Key features and benefits of Trane Remote Monitoring and Diagnostics A key feature and benefit of Trane Diagnostics remote HVAC monitoring is that it is a free tool for homeowners. It’s true. It provides you with peace of mind and saves your dealer time and money. Once this HVAC remote monitoring system is active, your dealer can see what is going on with your system at any given time. They can see: HVAC system configuration The schedule you have programmed in Temperature and humidity statistics and trends Your dealer automatically receives system alerts for routine maintenance as well as alerts of system malfunctions. They can run troubleshooting tests remotely to try and diagnose the issue. Remote diagnostics means you can get Trane support before you even notice a problem.

If you’ve heard about variable speed and multi-stage systems and are wondering what those words mean and which one is right for you, then learn more. Published: January 
                  31,
                  2023 If you’re looking to purchase an HVAC system such as an air conditioner or heat pump, you’ve likely come across the terms variable speed, two-stage, and single-stage – but, what do they mean? To further complicate things, you might even see words like two-speed or single-speed while doing your research, too. What all these terms are really referring to is the capacity at which your HVAC system is able to operate as it cools your home, and that’s all determined by the number of stages on the system’s compressor. Single-stage or speed systems have a compressor that can only operate at one setting. Meanwhile, two-stage or speed systems have compressors with two settings, and variable speed systems have compressors with multiple settings. Learn the key differences among these three systems, plus how to know which is best for your home. What is a single-stage system? Single-stage, or single-speed, systems are the most basic systems. They have two settings: on or off, meaning they operate at full capacity or not at all. These systems work at full speed to cool down hot outdoor temperatures that impact your home, as the system shuts off completely once the indoor temperature has cooled down. Because of the frequent switch from on to off, and because they can only operate at 100% max speed, single-stage systems are usually the most expensive to operate. What is a two-stage system? Two-stage, or two-speed, systems take single-stage systems up a notch and control the temperature in your home a bit more accurately. While single-stage systems must be at either 0% or 100% capacity, two-stage systems add more variety by offering a high and low setting. In most cases, the low stage operates around 65% capacity, while the high stage operates at 100% capacity. Compared to single-stage systems, the two-stage system offers a middle ground for temperature control. What is a multi-stage system? A multi-speed system is a bridge between a traditional two-stage system and a premium variable-speed system. Inverter-driven, multi-speed technology delivers higher efficiency and more cooling capacity at extreme temperatures when compared with a two-stage unit. This unit also offers enhanced humidity control. What is a variable speed system? Variable speed, or variable stage, systems are the most eff

                  2025 By Anne Fonda Comfort isn’t just about temperature—it starts with the air you breathe. Your indoor air quality can positively or adversely affect your health and your comfort. That’s why your Trane HVAC system works even smarter with the Awair Element, an indoor air quality monitoring device. It integrates directly with the Trane Home App and Trane Diagnostics. Trane has partnered with Awair to help you breathe easier and get peace of mind with accurate indoor air quality monitoring. Contact your local Trane dealer to learn more. What are some signs of poor indoor air quality at home? You may not even know that you have a high level of indoor air pollution. Some people are more sensitive to indoor air pollutants than others. Some key indicators of poor air quality include: Persistent odors Musty smell Increased dust High humidity or low humidity Mold growth Headache only at home Respiratory issues only at home We mention health issues at home for a reason. If you or a family member feels better when you’re at work or school, it’s time to do some investigating. What is air quality monitoring? Monitoring air quality involves installing an IAQ monitor in your home. Although air quality monitors aren’t perfect, they can help identify levels of pollutants, troublesome humidity levels, as well as problematic temperatures. How does the Awair air quality monitor work? This smart indoor air monitor helps you maintain a healthy home, using cutting-edge technology.  The signature design using a fan and laser sensor has undergone testing and modification since 2013, making it a leader in air quality monitoring. Source: Awair This smart home air quality monitor tracks 5 key environmental factors that affect your health. As shown in the graphic above, it displays status indicators with colored lights representing levels from Good to Hazardous and displays an Awair Score from 0 to 100. The higher the score, the better your indoor air quality. Let’s take a look at what factors the Awair Element monitors and how your smart HVAC system responds to levels less than Good. Temperature The device monitors your air temperature and gives a score for each level. For example, Good = 68-77°F. This is the indoor temperature range that is best for your comfort and health. The Acceptable, Moderate, Poor, and Hazardous temperature levels differ based on whether you are heating or cooling. When the Awair Element is linked to your smart HVAC system, temperatures outside the Good range can trigger the heat or air conditioning to come on. Hum

                  2023 Having a responsive smart programmable thermostat gives you connectivity and control over your home’s temperature from virtually anywhere, and conserves energy to reduce your utility costs. Smart thermostats, also known as connected thermostats, make changes for homeowners using artificial intelligence, helping homeowners save on energy costs. In 2021, smart thermostats were present in around 40 percent of U.S. homes, according to a Cornell University paper 1 , and that number continues to rise as homeowners are becoming more familiar with their benefits. What is a smart thermostat? A smart thermostat is a Wi-Fi-enabled thermostat that allows homeowners to achieve simple, precise temperature control from virtually anywhere with a smartphone, tablet, or computer. By connecting your HVAC system to the internet, smart thermostats allow you to control your home temperature remotely. They sense your home’s current temperature and then send a signal to your heating and cooling system to make the changes according to its pre-set schedule. Smart thermostats are Wi-Fi-enabled and allow homeowners to program heating and cooling settings based on daily schedules and even weather conditions. Eventually, smart thermostats won’t need to be programmed because they learn your heating and cooling patterns and adjust accordingly. How do smart thermostats work? You probably know thermostats monitor the temperature in your home and respond to programmed heating and cooling settings. But, how do they work? Essentially, a smart thermostat allows you to control the temperature in your home, and oftentimes other variables like humidity, too, with any web-enabled device. That means, homeowners can easily manage the temperature in their home via an app on their smartphone, tablet, or computer. Not only is this technology a faster and easier way to indoor comfort, but it can also save you money and energy, too. 5 benefits of a smart thermostat Here are five benefits to installing a smart thermostat , if you don’t already have one. 1. Smart thermostats allow you to use the heating and cooling functionality when you need it most Your smart thermostat can be set for home occupancy and some can even learn your home occupancy trends so that it heats or cools depending on when people are in the home, or about to be in the home. This means that you no longer have to worry about the house being at a

                  2025 By Anne Fonda Most of us take our home heating and cooling systems for granted. But we shouldn’t, because it’s crucial to our comfort and well-being. By staying on top of maintenance, working with trusted HVAC professionals, and taking advantage of smart diagnostics, you can save money and prolong the life of your HVAC system. To optimize your HVAC service visit and your home comfort , follow these tips. #1: Prep your space This may sound silly, but make sure your house number is easily visible from the street. Have it on the mailbox, mailbox post, or curb. Make it easy for the HVAC technician to confirm they’re in the right place. Inside your home, clear away boxes or anything else that blocks the indoor unit. You know they need to get to the unit. Don’t wait until they arrive to move things out of the way. Keep your pets confined. Outside, remove any decorative fence you have around the air conditioner or heat pump. Trim any bushes or grass two feet away from the unit. Clean up any dog doo in your yard if the HVAC service involves your outdoor unit. #2: Be responsive and understanding Many HVAC companies will send you a text or give you a call to let you know when the technician is on the way to your service appointment. If the text requires confirmation, please respond. If you have a “silence unknown callers” feature on your phone, disable it the day of the visit. An HVAC technician may call you to confirm their arrival. If you get a phone call, please answer. This is the company’s way of ensuring that you are home and prepared for their arrival. Don’t leave your home when you have an appointment in the next 15 minutes. They could be early. Once an HVAC technician is on site, they may find a problem with your system that requires a new part. Please know that while technicians may carry common parts such as capacitors and condensate drain tubes, they may need to go to a supply warehouse or schedule a second visit to replace larger parts such as an evaporator coil or condenser coil. #3: Be prepared to ask questions, but don’t micromanage Just like when you go to the doctor, be prepared to ask questions. The technician should arrive at your home with a clear idea of what is needed, but they may ask you questions about when the problem started, if you have noticed specific things, and more. After they have examined the unit and done some troubleshooting, you can ask some questions. Things like, what is the problem? Can you fix it today? How can I prevent the problem from happening aga

You might be surprised to learn this, but scientific research indicates that the air in some homes and buildings may be more polluted than the outdoor air.  And since Americans spend about 90% of their time indoors, poor IAQ can lead to discomfort and health problems. Understanding indoor air quality While pollutants, allergens, and irritants from individual sources may not pose a significant health risk individually, most homes have more than one source of indoor air pollution. According to both the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), long-term exposure to these pollutants can carry serious risks. The good news is that by understanding common pollutants and symptoms of poor indoor air quality, you can take steps to greatly reduce contaminants so that you and your family can breathe easy. Common indoor pollutants Indoor air quality can be affected by many pollutants including airborne particles/particulates you can see, and pollutants too small to be seen by the naked eye. These particles are measured in microns , a unit of measurement equal to one-millionth of a meter. Some of the most common indoor air pollutants include: Dust Dust mites Lint Hair Pollen Pet dander Mold spores Smoke Smog Viruses Bacteria Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) Sensitivity to indoor air pollutants and allergens will vary from person to person. If someone in your family has allergies, asthma, or a suppressed immune system, they will likely be the first to notice a problem. Health symptoms of poor indoor air quality Poor IAQ can cause health symptoms and exacerbate respiratory conditions. Common symptoms that can result from poor indoor air quality including: Red eyes Itchy eyes Sneezing Congestion Headaches Sore throat Coughing Worsening of asthma and other respiratory illnesses It’s important to note that irritation of the eyes, nose, and throat can be caused by the common cold or other respiratory illness. If these symptoms persist or resolve when you or a family member is away from home, IAQ problems may be to blame. Long-term exposure to certain indoor air pollutants can lead to long-term health effects. For vulnerable family members, improving indoor air quality can help improve their overall health – or at least not make it worse. Get Your Free IAQ Assessment Indoor air quality testing Indoor air quality testing or air quality monitoring can help you get an idea of the pollutants in the air you and your family are breathing. Most devices you can buy online don’t tell the whole story. We would suggest working with an HVAC professional who can perform a comprehensive indoor air quality assessment. Other companies specialize in IAQ testing, but they can’t supply heating, ventilating, and air conditioning solutions that target the air quality in your whole home. The exception would be the Awair® Element . T

Zoning systems split your home into various zones so that they can be either heated or cooled separately. Each zone is controlled by its own smart thermostat , so you can adjust the temperature in each area independently. This allows you to save energy by only heating or cooling the areas of your home that need it at any given time. There are several types of zoning systems available on the market today. The most common type is a ducted zoning system, which uses multiple HVAC dampers in your existing ductwork to control airflow into each zone. Other options include zoning systems that use zoning panels, zoning controllers and zoning valves. If you’re considering installing a zoning system in your home, there are a few things to keep in mind. First, zoning systems require additional equipment, such as dampers and zoning controllers. Additionally, zoning systems require professional installation, so it’s important to consult with a qualified contractor before beginning the process. Is HVAC zoning worth it? Usually, one heating and cooling system works to control the temperature of an entire home but in unique situations, temperatures may not distribute evenly. Heat may rise to the highest floors, for example. This is where a zoning system will work to adjust a single area of a home without affecting the lower floors of the residence. Overall, zoning systems can be an excellent way to save energy and maximize comfort in your home. By controlling the temperature in each zone independently, you can reduce energy waste and ensure that only the areas of your home that need heating or cooling are being heated or cooled. If you’re looking for ways to save on your energy bills and improve the comfort level in your home, then a zoning system may be just what you need! Learn more about how pairing a smart thermostat with the Home App results in Connected Comfort Solutions. Can you add zones to an existing HVAC system? Yes. You can add zones to your system however it’s best to do so if you have a variable speed blower and a variable speed outdoor unit to prevent loss of efficiency and wear and tear on equipment. In some cases, zoning systems are compatible with your existing HVAC system and can be added without needing any new components. It’s important to consult with a qualified contractor before beginning the process so that you know what is needed for your particular zoning system setup.

                  2023 In today's fast-paced world, energy efficiency has become a crucial aspect of daily life. As utility bills rise, homeowners are seeking innovative ways to save money without compromising comfort. Smart thermostats have emerged as a revolutionary solution, allowing homeowners to optimize energy consumption and reduce costs. In this blog, we will explore how smart thermostats like Trane ComfortLinkTM thermostats help save money and energy. For more information and to learn which smart thermostat may be right for your home, contact your local Trane dealer today. Understanding Smart Thermostats Do smart thermostats save money? Definitely! Do smart thermostats save energy? Absolutely! Investing in a smart thermostat is a smart decision for your home, your wallet, and the environment. Here’s how smart thermostats save money and energy. Unlike traditional thermostats, smart thermostats leverage advanced technology, including Wi-Fi connectivity and machine learning algorithms, to offer higher automation and control. These cutting-edge devices allow homeowners to remotely manage and program their heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems through smartphone apps or web interfaces. Moreover, smart thermostats can learn from user behaviors, adapt to preferences, and adjust the temperature settings accordingly, maximizing energy efficiency. Of course, you can adjust your settings manually with a traditional programmable thermostat . The problem is most people forget actually to do it. One study discovered that nearly 50% of households with programmable thermostats don’t set them up. Saving Money with a Smart Thermostat 1. Precision Temperature Control One of the key ways smart thermostats save money is through precision temperature control. Traditional thermostats rely on manual adjustments, often leading to temperature overshooting and wasting energy. Smart thermostats, on the other hand, can maintain a more consistent temperature by learning from occupants' patterns and adjusting heating and cooling cycles accordingly. For example, suppose a homeowner tends to lower the temperature during the night. In that case, the smart thermostat will recognize this pattern and automatically set a more energy-efficient temperature during those hours. This precise control prevents unnecessary energy consumption, translating into substantial cost savings over time. 2. Personalized Scheduling Another vital feature of smart thermostats is their ability to create personalized schedules. Homeowners can set specific temperature settings based on their daily routines, allowing the HVAC system to work more effi

Trane Diagnostics allows you to send data from your HVAC system to your preferred HVAC dealer in the industry, so they can remotely access real-time information about your HVAC system to diagnose, fix and even prevent system issues. With Trane Diagnostics, you can program your Trane Home-enabled smart thermostat to send data directly to your dealer, providing you with the peace of mind and reassurance that your HVAC systems are working to the best of their ability. So, what is Trane Diagnostics? What will the dealer see? Trane Diagnostics gives your dealer a peek into the overall operation of your system. There are two key concepts related to Trane Diagnostics: Once you enroll in Trane Diagnostics, your dealer can only see your enrolled system’s performance data. They won’t be able to see information from any other device in your home, even the ones connected to the Trane Home app. Your system’s data is completely encrypted, secured, and limited to the home you choose to link with Trane Diagnostics. What the dealer can see on your enrolled device includes temperature and humidity statistics, the thermostat’s temperature history, and your system’s temperature scheduling program if you have one. Your dealer will also receive system alerts that cover anything from routine maintenance reminders to system malfunctions. Remote Diagnostics: Allows your dealer to see basic data from your HVAC system. You only need to enroll one time, and your dealer will have access to data indefinitely, until you choose to opt out. Remote Access: Allows your dealer to tap into your Trane smart thermostat remotely to troubleshoot or fix a problem. This is separate from remote Trane Diagnostics, and every time a dealer wants remote access, you’ll need to approve or deny it. Remote access ends once the dealer has completed the job. How to enroll in remote Trane Diagnostics You can easily activate Trane Diagnostics from the Trane Home app or webpage. When you purchase a Trane system, you’ll be taken to the Trane Diagnostics page as part of set-up. The box or switch to enroll in Trane Diagnostics should be automatically checked when you visit the page, but it won’t be activated until you save the setting. Here’s how to do it: Enrolling with the app Step 1 Sign in to the Trane Home mobile app . Step 2 If you’ve connected multiple homes to the app, go to the dropdown menu and select which home you want to enroll in Trane Diagnostics. If you’ve connected just one home, move to step three. Step 3 Select the menu icon, then select “App Settings.” Step 4 Select “Home Settings.” Step 5 Find the text that reads: “Enable my HVAC dealer to see diagnostic information about my HVAC system, as well as my name and home address.” Ensure the switch to enroll is on the right to opt in to Trane Diagnostics; if not, slide the switch to the ri

                  2025 By Anne Fonda A smart HVAC system uses advanced technology and internet connectivity to improve system performance. These smart heating and cooling systems gather data, use predictive algorithms, and may use automation to enhance your home comfort and increase energy efficiency. Smart HVAC systems start with a smart thermostat A smart thermostat connects to your home’s Wi-Fi. At its heart, it’s a programmable thermostat, but it offers an array of features to help you customize your home comfort. Smart thermostats use HVAC sensors, automation, and remote access to deliver the right temperature, humidity, and airflow at the right time, without any manual adjustments. “Smart HVAC systems are a game-changer. By intelligently optimizing temperature and airflow, they not only deliver superior comfort and air quality, but also significantly cut energy waste, putting money back in your pocket and giving you long-lasting peace of mind.” -Michael Morey, Product Management Leader, Hardware Trane has some of the best smart thermostats on the market today, including two that work with non-Trane systems. Browse smart thermostats Other components of a smart HVAC system In addition to the smart thermostat, the basic components are an energy-efficient air conditioner or heat pump on the outside and an energy-efficient gas furnace or air handler on the inside. You may also have a packaged system . Your smart thermostat may also control indoor air quality (IAQ) equipment such as your whole-home humidifier, whole-home dehumidifier, ventilator, and whole-house air cleaner. Additional features While not necessary to comprise a smart system, a Link™ communicating variable-speed system can help maximize your comfort and energy savings. A zoned HVAC system offers the highest level of comfort, allowing you to customize temperature, humidity, and other settings for each zone. What are the benefits of a smart HVAC system? There are a lot of benefits to having a smart HVAC system. A few of those benefits include: Customized comfort Enhanced energy efficiency Remote control with the Home App Compatibility with voice assistants Integration with other smart devices Maintenance alerts How do smart HVAC systems work to enhance comfort? In addition to programming a schedule tailored to your comfort preferences, a smart HVAC system is at your beck and call, from the palm of your hand or by saying a few words. Think about the last time you woke up hot or cold at night. You probably got out of bed to open a window, turn on a fan, or add a blanket to the bed. With a smart thermostat

                  2025 By Anne Fonda You depend on your HVAC system to keep you and your family comfortable. But what happens when there’s a problem? Do you wish there were some way to head off small problems before they become big ones? There is. That’s what Trane Diagnostics and the Technician App are all about. What is Trane Diagnostics? Trane Diagnostics is a proprietary application and smartphone app. It’s an added feature you can opt into through the Trane Home App . It allows your Trane dealer to monitor your HVAC system remotely, much like a security company monitors your security system. Your remote monitoring-enabled Trane smart thermostat sends data about your HVAC system’s performance to your dealer in real time. If they spot an issue or get a system alert, they will ask for one-time permission to enable Dealer Remote Access (DRA) to start an HVAC troubleshooting session and fix the problem remotely if they can. It’s similar to how a remote IT person would get remote access to your work computer, poke around to see what’s wrong, and then fix the issue. If an on-site visit is required, your Trane dealer will send an HVAC technician to your home. Get more details in our homeowner’s guide to Trane Diagnostics . Please know that this service is only available with Trane smart thermostats and no other brand of smart thermostat. For your convenience, we have smart thermostats that are compatible with non-Trane systems. For instance, the XL824 smart thermostat is compatible with virtually all conventional HVAC systems and is Trane Home-enabled. What is the Technician App? Each Trane HVAC technician has the Trane® Technician app downloaded on their smartphone. It’s available through the Apple App Store and Google Play. The Technician App can help with accurate and timely HVAC replacement, HVAC diagnostics, and HVAC repairs, ensuring a smooth installation or HVAC service call. In addition, it ensures secure access to customer data and enables real-time monitoring of system alerts, improving diagnostics efficiency. Trane continually updates the app to resolve issues and improve performance, ensuring technicians always have the latest information. How does all this benefit me? Trane Diagnostics and the Technician App have revolutionized HVAC system diagnostics and repairs. As long as you have a Trane smart thermostat and you’ve enabled diagnostics in the Home App, you get the added protection and proactive service to help you maintain h

Whether you’re a new homeowner or a seasoned professional, if you’re looking for a brand new system or a replacement for an old one, it’s more than likely that you’ll find yourself working with an HVAC dealer at some point or another. Published: February 
                  7,
                  2023 Whether you’re a new homeowner or a seasoned professional, if you’re looking for a brand new system or a replacement for an old one, it’s more than likely that you’ll find yourself working with an HVAC dealer at some point or another. While HVAC can be complicated, working with a local Trane dealer will help make everything from exploration to purchase a breeze. Here are some simple steps and tips to help make the HVAC buying process and dealer interactions as seamless as possible. What can I expect when working with a dealer? Your HVAC dealer is there to help take the confusion out of heating and cooling by guiding you through every step of the way. These are the five general steps you can expect to follow as you start working with an HVAC dealer to find the perfect system for your home. Step 1: Submit a request To kick off the process of working with an HVAC dealer, you’ll need to submit a request. This can be done electronically in various places on the Trane residential website by using our contact a dealer form , or by calling our customer service number at 1-877-640-2497. Submitting a request lets us know you’re ready to begin the process of finding, replacing, or repairing your HVAC system. The information you provide online or over the phone will be sent to an independent Trane dealer in your area, who will then contact you to arrange a time to visit your home. Step 2: Assessment of needs After the initial request, the HVAC dealer will complete an assessment of your needs. This process can take place in person or over the phone. During this time, the dealer will get to know you and your lifestyle in order to find an HVAC system that fits your needs . The dealer will ask questions about the factors that are important to you in your new system, such as energy efficiency, noise level, indoor air quality, and more. This is your opportunity to tell your dealer exactly what you want to end up with at the end of the purchasing process. Step 3: Home review Next, your dealer will conduct a home review. This is a lengthy process, usually lasting around two hours, that provides your dealer with the logistical information necessary to find an optimal system for your needs. During the home review, the dealer will determine a load calculation, which helps determine the best type and size HVAC system for your home, in order to maximize comfort and efficiency. The load calculation takes into account factors such as home squ

NATE®, or North American Technician Excellence® is a nonprofit organization that works to make your wish for a great technician come true. NATE certifies HVAC technicians through a series of knowledge and experience-based testing, then initiates follow-up training and testing every two years. Its goal is for homeowners like you to feel confident you’re inviting a skilled, informed technician into your home whenever you need one. On the Trane website, look for the small house icon under a dealer to see if Trane has verified them as a NATE-certified technician. What is NATE Certification? NATE is a coalition made up of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and ASHRAE® (the American Society of Heating, Refrigeration and Air-Conditioning Engineers). The organization certifies heating, ventilation, air conditioning and refrigeration technicians with a series of tests. The organization works with a nationwide committee of HVAC experts to develop the NATE certification exams. The committee identifies Knowledge Areas of Technician Expertise (KATEs) by drawing from their own real-world job experience and work to create tests for technicians. If a technician passes all the necessary exams, they become NATE-certified. How do technicians become NATE-certified? To become NATE-certified, technicians must pass a series of tests with a 70% or higher. There are multiple types of exams offered to technicians, depending on the level of certification they want to achieve. Before being eligible for a NATE certification, technicians must pass two separate exams: the Ready-To-Work and HVAC Support Technician. Both of these exams are designed for technicians just entering the field and are recommended by NATE to be completed within the first six months to a year on the job. After passing both these exams and completing at least two years of work in the HVAC field, technicians are eligible to become NATE-certified via one of two paths: The Certified HVAC Professional (CHP-5) pathway , where a technician earns their certificate by passing a series of five exams: HVAC fundamentals, electrical and controls, comfort and airflows, installation, and service. The traditional NATE certification pathway , where a technician takes the NATE core exam and at least one NATE specialty exam in an area of their choosing to become certified. If a technician wants a higher level of certification beyond the standard NATE, they can earn their Senior Level Efficiency Analyst certificate. Technicians must hold two specialty-level NATE HVAC certifications (one in heating and one in cooling) to take the senior level test. How long does a NATE certification last? NATE certifications last two years, except for the ground source pump heat installer certification , which lasts three years. To recertify, technicians must complete

                  2023 Confused about home heating and cooling? It turns out you’re not alone. According to Consumer Reports, it turns out that 20 percent of Americans reported needing to repair or replace their HVAC systems in the last year – but the majority felt overwhelmed with the process. If you don’t know where to begin, don’t worry. Before you start a project or make a major HVAC purchase , we can help you get up to speed on what you need to know to make the best choice for you and your home. HVAC Meaning: What is HVAC? HVAC stands for heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems. This system is responsible for heating and cooling your home and includes products like furnaces, air conditioners, heat pumps as well as ductwork, thermostats and other home comfort controls. While the world of HVAC might seem complicated, it doesn’t have to be confusing for homeowners. Once you learn a little more about how the systems work, the HVAC meaning and all the technical components will make more sense, and you can learn even more by watching this video that discusses HVAC and working with an expert dealer . What is an HVAC system? There are many moving parts that work to not only warm you in winter and cool you in summer, but also filter and purify your air to help protect you and your family from allergens, pollutants, and harmful chemicals. Breaking down the different parts of an HVAC system, or the heating and cooling products within homes, can help you to understand each system’s role in bringing you comfort throughout the year. Watch this video on how HVAC systems work to learn more details on heating and cooling systems and how you can achieve optimal comfort in your home and get more information on each system below. Furnace Most people understand that a furnace heats a home, but don’t understand all the intricacies involved in the system. All furnaces consist of four main components: 1) burners that deliver and burn fuel, 2) heat exchangers, 3) a blower and 4) a flue that acts as an exhaust for gaseous by-products. A furnace generates heat by burning fuel and distributes the generated heat throughout the house. Air conditioner An air conditioner draws heat energy out of the house and transfers it to the outside air. The most common setup for residential homes is a split system, which includes an inside-the-home evaporative heat exchanger and an outside condensing unit heat exchanger. Heat pump A heat pump is an energy-efficient option to consider if you live in a mild climate zone. It uses the outside air to heat a home in winter and cool it in summer.

                  2025 By Anne Fonda It’s tough to give a quick answer here because a good SEER2 rating depends on what you want in a cooling system. We can tell you that energy-efficient AC systems and electric heat pump systems can lead to energy savings and lower utility bills. What does SEER mean in HVAC? A SEER definition First, the basics. Just what is SEER ? SEER stands for Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio. You may see it referred to as a SEER rating.  This is the ratio of the cooling output of an air conditioner or heat pump over a typical cooling season, divided by the energy it uses in Watt-Hours. Understanding SEER meaning Is a high SEER rating good? Yes. The higher the SEER, the more efficient a unit is at cooling your home. A heat pump or central air conditioner’s SEER energy efficiency rating is calculated over an entire cooling season using a constant indoor temperature and a variety of outdoor temperatures ranging from 65°F to 104°F. This is how it simulates a typical season. SEER2 is the AVERAGE efficiency across a wide range of conditions. So, it is like the ‘combined’ fuel efficiency of your car. You may get higher efficiency on the highway or lower efficiency in the city, but the average ‘combined’ efficiency you will see is like the SEER2 rating. The same goes for your air conditioner or heat pump. If your SEER is 20, that’s the efficiency rating, and it could be higher or lower depending on conditions. On Trane product descriptions, you may see “up to” when talking about the unit’s SEER rating. That means with the right matching equipment and optimal conditions, you may be able to increase efficiency beyond what the unit is rated for. SEER2 vs SEER definition Effective January 1, 2023, the Department of Energy (DOE) mandated updated HVAC energy efficiency standards. SEER2 is an updated version of the SEER calculation that uses the new M1 blower testing procedure. So, if you've shopped for a new unit in the past, you may recognize that SEER has changed to SEER2, as SEER2 represents the new standard. SEER2, or Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio 2, includes the total heat removed from the conditioned space during the annual cooling season, and the new M1 testing procedure increases the systems’ external static pressure by a factor of five to better reflect real-world conditions of installed equipment. *Based on national averages SEER2 vs EER2 EER2 stands for Energy Efficiency Ratio. It’s another HVAC efficiency metric that measures a unit’s cooling efficiency. The difference between SEER2 and EER2 The two metrics use different temperature conditions. EER2 measures efficiency at the peak cool

By Anne Fonda HVAC sizing is the calculation that HVAC contractors use to determine the proper air conditioner , heat pump , and furnace combination you need to heat and cool your home. For optimal comfort and efficiency, you need a system with the capacity to get the job done, but not too much or too little capacity. If you’re considering HVAC replacement, don’t just assume that your current units are the right size for your home. Work with an HVAC professional to calculate HVAC sizing when you’re replacing a system, but also when you’re building a new home. Since HVAC components can last 15-20 years, you want to get both the HVAC duct sizing and unit sizing right. Calculating HVAC Sizing: Tons, BTUs, Square Footage & More How to size an HVAC system accurately is something every HVAC technician learns. It involves the Manual J calculation . While you can use an online calculator yourself to get an idea of the cooling capacity you need for your home, your best course of action is to get a professional to do it. You’ll want to get familiar with some HVAC terms such as British Thermal Units (BTUs) and Tons/Tonnage . One ton of cooling capacity = 12,000 BTUs. So, that means a 3-ton AC unit or 3-ton heat pump = 36,000 BTUs. Proper sizing includes considering numerous factors, such as: What climate zone you live in Your cooling needs Home square footage The layout of your home The height of your ceilings How many windows the home has How much sunlight the home gets Your home’s ductwork Your home’s insulation and ventilation The current energy efficiency of the home Other heat-generating appliances You can also estimate HVAC sizing by using the square feet method. This AC tons per square foot calculation is not as accurate as the Manual J load calculation but can give you an idea of the system capacity you will need. This calculation has evolved over time due to construction material and insulation requirements used today vs historically.  Traditionally this estimation would be 600 SF/ton for residential, 800 SF/ton for apartments, 400 SF/ton for commercial, and 200 SF/ton for restaurants. But with the updated insulating material used in new construction, it may be closer to 1000 SF/ton for residential, running an actual load, especially as new construction could significantly decrease your initial cost and yearly energy load. Home size (sq. ft.) Unit Size (tons) Unit Size (BTUs) 1000 sq. ft. 2-ton AC unit/2-ton heat pump 24,000 BTUs 1500 sq. ft. 3-ton AC unit/3-ton heat pump 36,000 BTUs 2000 sq. ft. 4-ton AC unit/4-ton heat pump 48,000 BTUs 2500 sq. ft. 5-ton AC unit/5-ton heat pump 60,000 BTUs Choosing the Right HVAC System Size Choosing the right HVAC system size doesn’t have to be hard. Do your homework, do some math, and work with a trained HVAC professional. “ What size HVAC system do I need ?” is one of the most commonly asked questions we get. That’s why we’ve included detailed answers in our HVAC basics as well as our blog What Size HVAC Unit Do I Need ? Trane has air co

                  2018 Not all HVAC systems can be as good-looking or unstoppable as a Trane. Sometimes you have to bite the bullet and disguise an ugly unit or hide nice, new equipment that’s simply in the way. Fortunately, there are great products and tips available to help make the job easy. Just make sure they are placed far enough away (2 feet on all sides) from your unit that they don’t compromise the airflow and efficiency of your HVAC system. Now, check out these clever disguises! High Faux Greenery Privacy Screen from Brylane Home Here’s a smart way to hide your HVAC unit. Pretend it’s a bush. This faux ivy leaf netting mimics a tall hedge, so no one will guess what’s behind it and they’ll think you’re a great landscaper. It’s also easy to clean and maintain — just spray it with your hose. Keep in mind that you will need a fence to attach it to. If you prefer the real thing, here are some tips for doing your own landscaping around your HVAC unit . Wicker Screen Enclosure by Suncast This charming wicker screen will give your backyard a cottage garden feel and keep your HVAC unit tucked out of sight. It’s made from steel and resin, so it’s extra durable. It’s also powder-coated to resist rust, mildew, and fading. One of the best features is that it’s flexible and can be arranged in multiple ways to suit your needs. You will need to assemble it, but it’s freestanding so you don’t need to attach it to another structure. Mederlo 3-Panel Wood Screen If you’re looking for a simple and straightforward covering, this low lattice-style screen might be right for you. It’s easy to assemble and the hinged design makes it flexible to configure. One of the wins for this enclosure is that it comes in 4 colors — brown, natural, white, and grey wash. Red Cedar Privacy Screen for AC Unit from Green's Fence These easy-to-assemble red cedar panels offer a natural look that's rot-resistant.  The red cedar blends well into natural settings, but you can easily paint or stain it if that’s your style. The design isn’t your traditional lattice look, which will make your screen stand out — in a good way. Striped Screening from Dream Products A geometric design like this is right at home in a modern outdoor area. You can choose from green and white stripes or brown and white stripes. The only snag is that you’ll need a fence or wooden structure to hang the plastic mesh screen on. It may work best as a decorative element on top of one of the other wooden screen options. 4-Panel Bamboo Screen by Master Garden Products This screen has an Asian flair and an interesting bamboo design that would look great in a

SEER stands for Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio. SEER2 is an updated version of the previous SEER rating system for air conditioners and heat pumps. The Department of Energy (DOE) mandated that the changes go into effect on January 1, 2023. SEER2 measures air conditioner and heat pump cooling efficiency. It’s the ratio of total heat removed during the cooling season divided by the total electric energy used by the cooling unit during the same time frame. By Anne Fonda What’s the difference between SEER and SEER2? When it comes to SEER vs SEER2, SEER2 is a higher efficiency standard.  The new SEER2 metric utilizes a new M1 blower testing procedure . The updated testing procedure more accurately reflects real-world conditions for HVAC systems by changing the static pressure used in the testing lab from 0.1” w.g to 0.5” w.g. by up to 5 times. New testing procedures change the minimum energy efficiency required for cooling and heating systems. What’s the difference between SEER2 and EER2? EER2 is another measure of an air conditioner or heat pump’s cooling efficiency. The two metrics use different temperature conditions. EER2 measures efficiency at the peak cooling need when the outdoor temperature is 95°F, the indoor temperature is 80°F, and the humidity is 50%. SEER2 is an average of efficiency over the entire cooling season when temperatures range from 65°F to 104°F. If you live in a hot and dry climate such as the desert Southwest, or a hot and humid climate like parts of the Southeast, a unit’s EER2 rating might be more important to you than the SEER2 rating. Learn more about HVAC system efficiency metrics . What is a good SEER2 rating for a central air conditioner or heat pump? That depends on where you live and your climate. A higher SEER2 rating means greater energy efficiency. And since an AC unit or heat pump also dehumidifies while it cools, a more efficient unit also means greater comfort. The minimum standard SEER2 requirements for air conditioners vary by region in the United States. In the North, all types of air conditioners must have a rating of 13.4 or higher. In the Southeast and Southwest, SEER2 ratings depend on the type of air conditioner and capacity. Split system air conditioners throughout the Southeast and Southwest must have a SEER2 rating of 14.3 or higher if they have a capacity less than 45k BTU, and 13.8 or higher if they have a capacity greater than or equal to 45k BTU. Split system heat pumps must have a SEER2 of 14.3 or higher in all regions. Your actual HVAC system cooling efficiency will also depend on the size of your home, your current ductwork, and other variables. What is a good SEER2 rating for a packaged HVAC unit? Single-packaged air conditioners and heat pumps in all regions must have a SEER2 of 13.4 or higher. Again, the higher the rating, the more efficient the unit is. Talk with your Trane dealer about the best rating for your home and your comfort. What is a good SEER2 rating for a

A traditional split system has an indoor section commonly found in an attic or crawl space connected to an outdoor unit by line-sets that run between the two. A packaged system contains the “indoor” and outdoor sections in one self-contained cabinet that is located outdoors. They provide a single packaged cabinet with the necessary components to heat and/or cool all the rooms of your home. Packaged systems usually consist of some combination of an air conditioner, furnace, evaporator coils, condensers, humidifiers, air handlers, and other components. What are the benefits of packaged systems? There are several advantages to using packaged systems for your temperature control and comfort needs: Cost Savings: Installing a packaged system can save you money in both energy costs and installation costs. By having all the necessary components in one place, you don’t have to pay extra labor costs to install multiple units throughout your home. Energy Efficiency: Packaged systems can be more energy efficient than a split system because the “indoor” and outdoor sections have been tested together to optimize performance. This means that packaged systems can help you save on electricity bills while still providing effective temperature and comfort control. Space Efficiency: Because packaged systems are housed in a single cabinet outdoors, they do not take up significant space indoors like a split system. Packaged systems can fit many unique applications from a side-discharge ground-level application to various rooftop applications. Easy Maintenance: Since packaged systems often have all their key components in one place (e.g., 90% single-side service), maintenance is much easier than with split system units. You don’t have to search for each component when something needs attention – just open the cabinet and get to work! Choosing the right packaged system When selecting a packaged system, there are several factors to consider: Size and Capacity: Make sure you select a packaged system that is appropriate for the size of your home and can provide adequate temperature and humidity control. Type: There are different types of packaged systems available including air conditioner systems, dual fuel hybrid systems, gas/electric systems, and heat pump systems. Consider the type that would work best for your climate and budget, while considering your utilities and government rebates/incentives. Efficiency Ratings: Look for energy-efficient models that come with good ratings from Energy Star or other organizations like AHRI (Air Conditioning, Heating, Refrigeration Institute). This will help ensure that you are getting a packaged system that will provide efficient performance and cost savings for the long run. Installation: Packaged systems generally require professional installation services. (Find a Trane packaged system installer near you.) What types of packaged systems are available?

                  2024 Trees and bushes can damage your HVAC system without proper care. They can block proper airflow, which can make your system work harder than it should. Discover the best ways to landscape around your outdoor system. Review our tips for landscaping around your HVAC systems 1. Leave the proper clearance When planning the landscaping around your air conditioning unit or heat pump, you want to leave adequate space between the unit and your plants to avoid restricting airflow around the coils. Make sure plants are at least 2-3 feet from the unit on all sides, and plan the landscaping so that the air conditioner is easily accessible for maintenance and repairs. If you have trees or other plants growing above the unit, trim regularly to keep a 5-foot clearance between them and the air conditioner. If space is tight, consider an air conditioner privacy screen as an alternative. 2. Mow carefully When you mow the lawn, if you have a side discharge mower, mow beside the outdoor unit with the discharge shoot pointing away from the HVAC unit. 3.

Hedges are a common choice, and can be trimmed to your desired shape and height. Building a lattice around the outdoor unit and landscaping with climbing plants is also a relatively simple and attractive option , but be sure to keep it well away from the unit. Avoid shrubs with invasive root systems and heavy pollen. Plants like bamboo, willow, and certain types of ivy have aggressive root systems that can infiltrate the HVAC unit. Certain flowering plants, such as oak trees, can release large amounts of pollen, which can clog the HVAC unit. Whatever landscaping options you choose, make sure to trim plants, hedges, and trees near the air conditioner regularly to maximize airflow and efficiency. 4. Make the most of the shade In addition to making the area look more natural, landscaping around your air conditioner can actually help improve its efficiency. By strategically placing trees, shrubs, or hedges around (but not too close) your HVAC unit, you can create a natural barrier that helps to deflect wind and insulate the system. This reduces strain on the HVAC unit, allowing it to operate more efficiently. Shade cast on the air conditioner keeps the temperature down so the unit doesn't have to wo
